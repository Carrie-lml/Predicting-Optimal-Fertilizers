# Predicting-Optimal-Fertilizers
This project was inspired by a Kaggle competition: Playground Series, Season 5, Episode 6, it aligns perfectly with my interest in data-driven sustainable farming. The goal is to use data science and artificial intelligence to predict the best fertilizer for different crops, based on factors like soil quality, weather, and crop type.
